# Various-AHK-Stuff
Stuff that I've made in AHK to be used wherever I like or not. cool Stuff, not so cool stuff, whatever.


# Breakdown

These are mostly broken up by 2 categories: Useful and Game.

Game are all for various games, and are broken down by such. There are plenty of things that get made just for specific games, and this gets updated the most as I play more games where Id like to have scripts for.

Useful are usually things that I use for making other scripts. Useful to have. These rarely get updated unless I find or make new ones that are particularlarly useful.
